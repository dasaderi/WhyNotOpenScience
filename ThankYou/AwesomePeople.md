## People who help are wonderful!

Taking our inspiration from Bastian, Helge and Phillip at [openSNP](https://github.com/openSNP/snpr) we want a 'people who deserved to be thanked for their contributions!' file. This is it! If you have contributed to the Why Not Open Science? project then we want to say a big THANK YOU! for all your help and hard work and ideas and everything you have done to make this project even better! Here is a nice little gif that says thanks!
