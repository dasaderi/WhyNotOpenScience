### What are we working on right now?

We are at Stage 1 of our mission, *Listen*. We want to assess researchers' attitudes towards open science and learn about the main barriers to fully adopt open science practices in their daily routines. To do that we are designing a survey that we are hoping to distribute to scholars around the globe. 

[This](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) is our project roadmap, and you can find issues under the issues tab at the top, or [here](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience/issues). Our milestones and aims are listed as issues so you can read through them or search for the labels. If you are new to contributing, we have some [good first bugs](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience/labels/good%20first%20bugs) you can check out.

### The survey

We (Amie and Daniela) are not survey experts so we turned to our network and we got in contact with Abdoul Caulibaly at the awesome Mozilla, and Bianca Kramer and Jeroen Bosman from 101 Innovations in Scholarly Communication and librarians at Utrecht University. They helped us figure out the following important points to consider when designing a survey. Thank you guys!

* __Be neutral__ in the language and throughout the survey. A general good rule of thumb is that nothing should suggest that we prefer one type of answer rather than other. Doing so will lead the respondent toward answering in the direction they consider is good for us. This is a tough one for us as we are obviously biased as open science advocates.

* __Code questions as much as possible__. This means that when we can we should try to present option answers for each question to ease the data analysis. However, some of the questions should be open, particularly the questions where we are trying to get an opinion. For these questions we may influence responses by providing a list of answers.

* __Keep the survey short and easy__. People are very busy and we need to think about the trade-off between "nice to know" *versus* "must know" based on what we want to obtain from the survey.

* __Make the survey in different languages__ or at least consider translation equivalents and cultural differences when designing the questions.
 
* __Get ethical approval__ to survey people and use the results.

* __Be visual__ as much as possible with the survey.

* __Make it mobile-friendly__.

* __Tweet__ it out when it's ready.

* __Be honest and clear__ about the intentions, how long the survey takes, and what will happen with the data.
 
* __Have a progress bar__.

* __Use forking strategies__ to skip questions that don't apply.

* __Give feedback__.


We are trying our best to address these points in our pilot survey. When you review it, please keep these points in mind and tell us where and how we can do better. Thanks!


### How to contribute?

1. **Fork the repository**. Create your own version of the repository.
2. **Make your changes**. Change the project and work on your idea.
3. **Commit changes**. Commit your changes.
4. **Create a pull request**. Submit a pull request to ask to integrate your changes to the master branch.  

If you want to take the pilot survey and provide us with feedback on it then please:
1. **Raise an issue**. Raise an issue called _Taking pilot survey_.
2. **Access the [pilot survey](https://goo.gl/forms/GHoujo8N45w112BG2)**. Fill in the survey and feedback sections (if you wish).
3. **Comment on your issue** with _Survey done!_
4. **Comment on your issue with any specific comments/questions or feedback**. Anything you want to tell us will help! By commenting on the issue, we can start discussing.

#### How to report bugs?

There are bound to be bugs in any project, and so we would love it if you could be on the lookout for any bugs, and raise an issue if you find one. Bugs can be anything - they could be with our conceptual design, with how we set something out, spelling mistakes or formatting errors, or anything else we haven't yet thought of.

If you notice a bug, then raise an issue and label it with the label 'bug'. Then anyone in the contributing community can get right on it, and everything gets fixed faster. THANK YOU!
